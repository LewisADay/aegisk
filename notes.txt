For scalar / Gaussian we use inverse (reciprocal) Gaussian distribution

scalar * inverse Gaussian form determined in tests.ipynb

Reverted to old string based class fetching
need to integrate changes into getattr fetchable mannor, mainly by making all edits to existing files in appropriate places,
or by including in relevant __init__.py files so to be captured by the module wide addressing

Need to rewrite ipynb's to reflect these changes, mainly through correctly addressing the time distributions for now
and making the necessary edits to the appropriate function calls, moving away from the class passthrough structure
